To avoid this uncomfortable experience you can perform the simple exercise, that will relax your shoulders and neck. The process is simple, stand up and try to reach your arms behind you interlocking your fingers and lifting arms at the same time. Ideally, you should feel the stretch in shoulders and chest while you’re performing the exercise. Repeat several reps.",
